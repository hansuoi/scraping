Follow Mia OUTSIDE, where we see the       splash of blue-green that is the POOL -- and a flurry of FAKE       SNOW falling from above...        As we reach FULL-SPEED, a PARTY-GOER races to the edge, jumps --        -- and we PLUNGE WITH HIM INTO THE POOL.        This is the climax of the number. Everyone joins in,       circling the pool -- a swath of color against the black sky.       Everyone dances, everyone sings -- and the song concludes       with a blast of fireworks.\n",

Projector light cuts through the darkness. And      then, as the movie's credits start up, Sebastian spots, out of      the corner of his eye, a figure in the aisle...       He looks. The figure turns. Looks at him. It's Mia.       And, caught like a freeze-frame in the projector   light, her      green dress incandescent, the giant movie screen   behind her      like a great piece of back-projection, she looks   more beautiful      than ever right now. A true old-fashioned screen   siren.       Sebastian's eyes go wide. He's surprised. And thrilled. He      waves. Mia hurries toward him.

He      has a beautiful voice. Mia bobs her head. It's just Keith and      Sebastian right now, all acoustic, a simple, catchy tune...

It's a full-out LIGHT SHOW      now, shafts of red, blue, green and orange cutting through      the dark. The crowd starts CHEERING, pumping their fists...       Mia looks at Sebastian. He's not fighting any of this. He      sees her. She smiles. But something is changing in her      expression...       She looks at the lights, the singers, the dancers, Sebastian      and his bandmates in matching magazine-cover-ready outfits.

      "writing:  Mia and Sebastian walk together outside -- but now that we're          outside we realize this isn't the real L.A. at all..           This, in fact, is an L.A. that doesn't exist. A painted-          backdrop L.A., just like the one we saw Mia pass by when          parking on the lot...           The old orange groves and the gabled rooftops and the moss-          covered bungalows and the ivy-decked lamps, the jacaranda          trees and the giant hills and Griffith and the Santa Monica          Pier -- all painted, all props, all figments of a studio-          backdrop imagination. We've entered a fully fantastical          realm, the realm of the old Hollywood ballets of the 40's and          50's...  A148     Everyone DANCES -- the pedestrians and the street performers          and the cops and the guards... AMY BRANDT races up to Mia --          seems to beckon her to audition... We see the audition          silhouetted against a wall... We don't hear Mia sing, but the          music takes on the melody of her song, carrying us to...  B148     PARIS... Sebastian travels there with Mia... We chart the          journey through an OLD GLOBE -- the same one we saw Mia use          for her play -- a miniature plane and dissolves, the old-          Hollywood-movie way...           Finally, we find ourselves looking at a PAINTED BACKDROP of          Paris -- the same one Mia used for her play. The Sacré-Coeur          and the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower etched in bright          colors, the ornate lampposts and the cobblestones stretching          before us... And then a sign -- \"CAVEAU DE LA HUCHETTE\"...  C148     We see a jam session at the Caveau -- a crypt-like jazz club.          Sebastian plays, on cloud nine...  C148pt   We see a MOVIE SHOOT, Mia surrounded by lights and cranes,          decked in movie-movie glow.           We're BACK to the Caveau. The lights go out -- except for the          TRUMPETER, playing out a lovelorn solo, rim-lit. We MOVE in          close on his horn -- DIVE into the bell --  D148     -- and emerge into NIGHTTIME PARIS. All painted. Mia and          Sebastian wander through this wonderland, pedestrians frozen          around them... Finally, they stop and look at one another...           And -- as the city lights behind them start to glitter like          all the stars of the galaxy...           ...they DANCE.                                   Revision                        84.         This is the last time we'll ever see them dance, and they       seem to recognize that, so graceful and poised are their       movements... Remember -- this is a romance more perfect than       a real romance could ever be...        We DISSOLVE again -- to a projector beam...        16mm footage plays on a screen, full of scratches and pockets       of light... Mia and Sebastian sit down to watch together --       and we see the following moments in brief, vivid GLIMPSES, as       we move in closer on the imagery:  149   The first home... (16mm)  150   Mia's pregnancy... (16mm)  151   The newborn child... (16mm)  152   The child's first birthday... (16mm)  153   The child's first day of pre-school, all dressed up... (16mm)        Everything here glows with the warmth of old home movies...       These are memories, fluttering by, grabbed at random -- and       yet all concocted, dreamed up out of nothing... The SCORE       continuing to sway and taking us right up to...  154   Sebastian and Mia, husband and wife, father and mother,       hiring a babysitter because they've decided to go out for a       night at the movies... (We're back to 35mm now.) The look       here is unaffected, just everyday. The MUSIC quiets slightly,       everything goes more natural, as this happily married couple       hit the road...  155   ...then find themselves blocked by a traffic jam...then take       a side route, winding up in another part of L.A...  156   ...then walk down the street, then hear music -- a jazz combo       playing somewhere...  157   ...and step into a place that looks just like Sebastian's       club... They sit down to listen...        And then -- and this is how our imagined montage-musical       number ends -- the combo's PIANIST, who of course is not       Sebastian, launches into Mia and Sebastian's melody...        ...and Mia and Sebastian look at each other, recognizing it.        The music goes full-circle, back to where it started, as Mia       and Sebastian look into each other's eyes, lean in and,       softly, but with all the love in the world...\n",
